A year of poking and prodding around other peoples websites, a year of reading all the guidelines out there about how to build a website. A year of experimenting with various tools and technologies. It's been quite a journey.


To be honest, it's obviously taken far longer than a year. The last few months have seen me focus far more attention on turning a fascination with all things computer based into a business, but Sir Clive Sinclair grabbed my attention long before that.


For younger readers, Sir Clive was the gentleman who brought home computing to the UK masses. Whilst many of my friends used the humble ZX81 as an early games console, I found myself spending hours laboriously typing in code to discover what magic I could create.


There has been a steady progression from the days of Sinclair Basic through to the obsession with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that make pages like this appear on your screen.


This website is to become my playground. Here I intend to document the creation of websites, trials of the 'next big thing' (which tend to appear every 6 months or so in the world of web development, some of which stay around, some of which disappear as quickly as they arrived.), and probably bemoan examples of what I see as incredibly poor practice.

I'll also look at how effective online marketing and Social Media can be in promoting yourself or your business.
 

If you have any interest in having your own website, please keep visiting as nothing will stay the same for too long in here. If you've already decided you want to hire me, head over to [my contact page](/#contact) and get in touch.

There you have it, the awkward first post ... didn't turn out too bad.
