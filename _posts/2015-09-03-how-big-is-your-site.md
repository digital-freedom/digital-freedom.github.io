When I sat down to start creating the new [Brora Rangers FC](http://brorarangers.football) website I had a good hard think about what it really had to achieve. 

My two main frustrations with the existing site, and many websites, was how long it took for the page to appear and allow me to interact with it, and the difficulty of finding the particular piece of information I was looking for. Navigation and layout can be chopped and changed once a site is up and running and I can analyse how people use it. Site speed needs some consideration before a single line of code is written.

Broadly speaking, websites can be split into two types: dynamic and static. Dynamic sites build their pages 'on the fly', that is, the web server doesn't put the page together and send it to your phone or computer until you request a certain page on the site. The server has to figure out what content to display, it has to get this information from a database and then it finally it serves the content up to your visitor.

A static website on the other hand is a fully built webpage, the webserver doesn't have to run any code to understand what it should be displaying, it doesn't have to query a database to find the information for the page content. Naturally it's faster. 

The Brora Rangers site has to handle quite a bit of information through the season, news updates, match reports, fixture lists and squad statistics were our starting points with other features to be added throughout the coming season. It will become a relatively big site, it will require frequent updates, but I was convinced I didn't need to use any of the heavyweight solutions such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) or [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) that power millions of websites. 

If you are looking for a simple website which advertises your business, makes it easy for existing and prospective customers to get in touch with you and has an easy to update section for news items this has many advantages. I've taken things to the extreme with the Brora Rangers site, but it certainly keeps everything fast.

There are big cost savings to be made here too for small businesses. Your website needs to live on a server so the rest of the world can connect to it. Servers that are powerful enough to handle scripting languages and databases cost money, servers that can do this quick enough to deliver a pleasant browsing experience for your visitors cost more money. Static sites, like the Brora Rangers site, or this one, can be hosted for free. That's free as in properly free - not free as long as your site carries advertising of the suppliers choosing, or free for a year but then you have to pay, just free. Paying for a developer to build a functional site with no additional hosting charges becomes very cost efficient.

So, before plunging in to Wordpress or some of the heavyweight online site builders that use server side scripting languages and databases, think about how big your site is ever really going to be and consider delivering your content with a static website.
