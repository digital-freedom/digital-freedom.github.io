The folks at Isle of Harris Car Hire had only one thing on their mind when we first discussed building a new website. Google Search, first place, top of the page, numero uno.

They had an existing website, which wasn't mobile friendly, and wasn't receiving much traffic. It was built with [Webydo](http://www.webydo.com/), one of the many online website builders which claim to make creating the perfect website easy. It doesn't. To be honest, it doesn't even make creating a pretty poor website easy.

Back in April 2015 Google made a major change to their search algorithm effectively leading to the removal of non mobile friendly sites from mobile search. Whilst the existing Isle of Harris Car Hire site had all the information anyone needed to hire a car from them, it was never going to hit the first page in a Google search. A relatively new business, trying to build a new customer base was going to be all but invisible.

The project for Isle of Harris Car Hire was twofold. Create a new responsive website, and raise their online profile.

Creating the website was the easy bit. The purpose of the site was to make it easy for visitors to understand what Isle of Harris Car Hire have to offer; where they operate, what vehicles they have, how much they charge, and easy methods to get in touch to either ask for more information or simply to book a car. Car hire doesn't get much more complicated than that. It had to be 'mobile friendly', which also means it has to be fast.

There isn't much to update on the site on a reguar basis so I did away with the usual heavy handed Wordpress or Joomla type Content Management System and created a flat file static site. This, along with sane design decisions, makes it blazingly fast. For first time visits pages take less than 2 seconds to appear on a half decent 3G phone signal and under 1 second on most home broadband connections.

I like that, more importantly, Google like that, and most important of all, your visitors and potential clients like that.

Work behind the scenes, both on the website and with Google, Facebook and Twitter, ensured the site was discovered. Whilst it requires both more work and time to ensure any website ranks well in a Google search, Jamie reports that enquiries from the site have increased greatly and his phone has never been busier.

The World Wide Web never stands still, your website can never stand still. I work with Isle of Harris Car Hire throughout the year to ensure changes are made when required and that Social Media such as Facebook and Twitter are used to help keep the site popular and busy.
