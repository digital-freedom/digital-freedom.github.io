Brora Rangers FC are an ambitious Club currently playing in the Scottish Highland Football League. 

As part of their ambitions for the Club it was decided that a new website was in order. The brief was simple ... it had to be fast, it had to work well on mobile devices, and it had to stand out from the crowd.

A browse through dozens and dozens of the official websites of football clubs from leagues throughout the UK and Europe left me with the sinking feeling that this was a part of the web which was stuck in the era of Berti Vogts and all that was dismal and drab. (Or worse, colourful, garish and confusing.)

The Board's wish to push the new site live as early in the season as possible helped decide the overall design. By splitting sections into modules on the home page we were able to launch the site with the sections the Club felt were most important first and will be able to add additional features as the season progresses.

It was also the modular approach that tempted me to break away from the standard clunky Content Management Systems that are usually employed for this type of site, with all the security risks and requirement for relatively expensive servers that come with them. News items, match reports etc are stored in simple text files; player statistics, fixtures and results live in spreadsheets that the site automatically picks up any updates from.
