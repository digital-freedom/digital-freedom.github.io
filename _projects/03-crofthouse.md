Charlie and Marine have plenty to do without worrying about how their website works. They need to let visitors to the site see when the cottage is booked and when it is free, and this needs to be live, up to date information. Many websites require that you log into an admin panel to update this ... not on The Croft House website. All the booking information is kept up to date on the same Google Calendar that they use to keep track of who is arriving when anyway. Update confirmed bookings in one place, and let the website take care of itself.

I'd already built this site for The Croft House, it was the first site I'd created for someone else and was my first foray into building a site from scratch. This is one of the strongest arguments for getting a Web Developer on board for your website. Unlike printed media a website should never stand still. Launching a website and assuming that customers will come to you just isnt going to work.

For **The Croft House**, Marine and Charlie worry about bookings and I worry about the hosting, design and SEO for the website. I get on with my business of running websites and it lets them get on with theirs.
