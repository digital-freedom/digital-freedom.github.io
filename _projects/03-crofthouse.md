Charlie and Marine have plenty to do without worrying about how their website works. They need to let visitors to the site see when it is booked and when it is free, and this needs to be live, up to date information. Many websites require that you log into an admin panel to update this ... not on The Croft House website. All the booking information is kept up to date on thesame Google Calendar that they use to keep track of who is arriving when anyway. Update confirmed bookings in one place, and let the website take care of itself.

I'd already built this site for The Croft House, it was the first site I'd created for someone else and was my first foray into building a site from scratch. It's a perfect example of why your website can't stand still. Something that worked 6 months ago may not work now. To me, that's the key to getting a real web developer to build your site, and then undertake to manage it.

Building sites are the easy bit for me, making sure they work on all screen sizes and for different browsers can be a pain, but nothing compared to keeping your site up to date and easily found found by search engines.
