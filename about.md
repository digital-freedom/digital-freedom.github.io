## About

###Hello.

####I'm a freelance web developer and designer based in the North of Scotland. 

I'm passionate about the way websites look and perform. I'm fascinated with technology and the online world, I'm a fan of the Open Source movement, and I get very frustrated with poorly designed and built webites. I'm on a mission.

There are many reasons to have a website, but they should all have a few things in common. They should be fast, they should entertain and they should inform.

This is my little space on the World Wide Web. Here I hope to entertain and inform you, without frustrating pauses waiting for a page to load. 

If this makes you get in touch to discuss creating a space on the Web for you, I'll be even happier.
